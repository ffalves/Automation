# Automation tasks with python

This repository gathers my pythons scripts for automating simple taskes.

It´s a study repository based on YouTube video tutorials and book tutorials and made just so I can practice my skills in problem solving and simple tasks as well as practicing python.

As I create new scripts, it'll be added here, as well their sources with credits (if applicable).
